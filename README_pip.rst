Behatrix
=======================


Behatrix is a program for the analysis of behavioral sequences.


By using a flexible and efficient approach, Behatrix allows analyzing large sets of behavioral sequences
and can organize data into contingency tables. The program can also perform permutations test and autonomously
generate the code for a flow diagram representing the transitions between behaviors.



Features
=======================

- Behaviors statistics
- Transitions statistics
- Flow diagram
- Permutations test



Requirements
